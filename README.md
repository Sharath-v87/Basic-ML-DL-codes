# Basic ML/DL codes

## Cats and Dogs classifier
This is my first ML model which can classify between cats and dogs. Here the accuracy is around 75%, however , the accuracy can be increased by implementing more and more filters such as in three block VGG models or even better, the VGG-16 model.

### The ds store finder
This finder is especially for mac os users who would have tough time dealing with deleting all the hidden ds store folders in their data set folders.

## OCR
A simple CNN model to detect hand writter characters.
